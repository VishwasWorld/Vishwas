The trajectory outlines an iterative development process for a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) for a company named Vishwas World Tech. The project started with a user request for a basic dashboard with employee management and attendance tracking. The AI engineer successfully built this MVP using a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

Following the successful MVP, the user made a series of feature enhancement requests, which the AI engineer implemented incrementally. Key features added include:
1.  **Document Generation:** Creation of PDF offer letters and appointment letters.
2.  **Salary Calculation:** A comprehensive module to calculate salaries, including Indian government-compliant deductions for ESI, PF, and PT, and generation of salary slips.
3.  **Legal Agreements:** Generation of employee agreements with legal clauses, company details, and a late-login penalty system.
4.  **Branding and UI/UX Overhaul:** Integration of the company logo, watermarks on all documents, and a complete redesign of the dashboard for a more professional and elegant look, including specific color schemes and an embossed logo.
5.  **Enhanced Functionality:** Addition of features for deleting employees, uploading employee documents, and a company announcements system.

The trajectory ends with a new set of complex requests for a major dashboard restructure, digitally signed salary slips with multi-channel sharing, and several other new modules. The AI engineer had just begun creating placeholder files for these new features, setting the stage for the next development cycle. The process demonstrates a highly agile and responsive development workflow, directly translating user feedback into functional application features.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a comprehensive Human Resource Management System (HRMS) for Vishwas World Tech Pvt Ltd. The application should serve as a central dashboard for HR administrators to manage the complete employee lifecycle.

**Initial MVP (Completed):**
*   Secure admin login portal.
*   Dashboard with key metrics: total employees, attendance status (present, absent, online).
*   Employee management: View a list of all employees with their details (ID, department, designation, contact).
*   Attendance tracking: A system to log employee clock-in and clock-out times, with status visibility.

**Feature Enhancements (Completed):**
*   **Document Generation:** Generate PDF documents for individual employees, including Offer Letters, Appointment Letters, and legally compliant Employee Agreements.
*   **Salary Management:** An integrated salary calculator that processes salaries based on attendance, calculates statutory deductions (PF, ESI, PT) as per Indian government norms, and generates salary slips.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Implement a late-login policy with automatic salary deductions.
*   **Branding & UI:** A complete UI overhaul featuring the company logo, a professional color scheme, watermarks on all generated documents, and an embossed logo on the main dashboard.
*   **Core HR Functions:** Functionality to add new employees, delete existing employees, upload employee-specific documents, and post company-wide announcements.

The application has evolved from a simple MVP into a feature-rich, branded HR management tool, covering recruitment, onboarding, attendance, payroll, and compliance.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python web framework)
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions
- **PDF Generation:**  Python library
- **Password Security:**  and  for hashing
- **Image Processing:**  for logo and watermark integration
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monolithic full-stack architecture with a React frontend communicating with a FastAPI backend via a REST API. The backend handles business logic and database interactions with MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**

-   **/app/backend/server.py**
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the FastAPI application. It defines all API endpoints, handles CORS, connects to the MongoDB database, and integrates all the modular business logic from other backend files.
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified to add endpoints for login, employee CRUD, attendance, document generation (offer letter, appointment letter, agreement), salary calculation, announcements, and document uploads.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Importance:** The root component of the React application. It manages the application's state, routing (views), and renders all other components. It contains the logic for fetching data from the backend and displaying it.
    -   **Changes:** Evolved from a simple component to a complex state machine managing multiple views (Dashboard, Employees, Attendance, Documents, Announcements), handling user interactions, and integrating various new components for enhanced functionality and UI.

-   **/app/backend/document_generator.py, salary_calculator.py, etc.**
    -   **Importance:** These files modularize the backend logic. Each file is responsible for a specific feature (e.g., generating a specific type of document, calculating salary), making the main  file cleaner and easier to maintain.
    -   **Changes:** These files were created from scratch to implement specific user-requested features.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/**
    -   **Importance:** This directory holds reusable React components that make up the UI. This promotes a component-based architecture, improving code organization and reusability.
    -   **Changes:** This directory and its components were created to build the sophisticated, multi-tabbed UI, including the professional header, footer, and various management dashboards.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement a standard salary slip format with digital signatures.
-   Integrate multi-channel sharing (Email, WhatsApp, SMS) for salary slips.
-   Redesign the dashboard layout: logo/address on the left, HR login info on the right.
-   Restructure the dashboard into 5 tabs: Employee Database, Interview Scheduled, Working Employee Database, Announcements, and Yearly Holiday Calendar.
-   Build out the Working Employee tab with detailed attendance, salary deductions, and document management.
-   Design and implement a professional footer with company address, map, and social media links.
-   Ensure Joining Date is included in the employee database.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the initial phase of a major application overhaul based on a large set of new user requirements. The user requested a complete restructuring of the dashboard into five specific tabs (, , , , ), a professional footer, a standardized salary slip with digital signatures and multi-channel sharing, and several UI/UX refinements.

In response, the engineer had just finished creating several new placeholder files to structure the upcoming work. These include backend modules like  and , and frontend components like , , and .

The immediate task was to start populating these newly created files with the required business logic and UI code to realize the user's vision for a more comprehensive and professionally designed HRMS. The system's architecture was being expanded to accommodate these new, distinct modules. No functional code for these new features has been written yet; only the file structure has been prepared.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the new backend modules (, ) into the main  file and add the corresponding API endpoints for the new dashboard tabs.
